# DayCellView

## DayCellView

We'll add a cell to show the information for each day.

```swift title='/UI/DaysView.swift'
struct DayCellView: View {
    @ObservedRealmObject var day: Day
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text("\(day.date.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .omitted))")
                .font(.title)
        }.padding()
    }
}
```

And we'll use it

```swift title='/UI/DaysView.swift'
ForEach(days) { day in
    NavigationLink(destination: Text("TO DO")) {
        DayCellView(day: day)
    }
}
```
