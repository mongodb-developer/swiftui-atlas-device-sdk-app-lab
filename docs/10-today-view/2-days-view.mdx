# Days View

## Renaming TodayView

As we'll showing not only today, but all our days we'll call this `DaysView`

## Creating our Days view

Our DaysView will show all the days where we've been tracking our habits. For each day, a new row will be added.

We'll start with a quite simple SwiftUI view with just an empty `NavigationStack`. We query all `Day` instances in our Database to show them.

```swift title='/UI/DaysView.swift'
import SwiftUI
import RealmSwift

// This shows all days, we can click on a day to navigate and check habits or add
// a new day
struct DaysView: View {
    @ObservedResults(Day.self) var days
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
        }
    }
}
```

## Showing all days

To show all days, we'll use a `ForEach`

```swift title='/UI/DaysView.swift'
struct DaysView: View {
    @ObservedResults(Day.self) var days

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            // new code here ðŸ‘‡
            List {
                ForEach(days) { day in
                    Text("\(day.date)")
                }
                .onDelete(perform: $days.remove)
            }
            .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
            .navigationTitle("All Days")
            .navigationBarItems(trailing: EditButton())
            // new code here ðŸ‘†
        }
    }
}
```
