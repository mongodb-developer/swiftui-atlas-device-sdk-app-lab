# Display a List of Habits!


## Observing a list of all Habits 

To display the list of habits we'll be creating in `ConfigView`, we'll start by adding to `ConfigView` all the `Habits` from the local DB

```swift title='UI/ConfigView.swift'
@ObservedRealmObject var habits: Habits
```

This works as a query, reading all objects of type `Habit` from our local DB. As this is `Observed`, any changes will be reflected automatically in the View.

## Update Preview code

We need to add the parameter `habits` when we instantiate a new `ConfigView` in the Preview.

```swift title='UI/ConfigView.swift'
struct ConfigView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ConfigView(habits: Habits())
    }
}
```

## Update `MainView`

As we also use `ConfigView` in `MainView` we need to update the code

```swift title='UI/MainView.swift'
            ConfigView(habits: Habits())
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "wrench.and.screwdriver")
                    Text("Config")
                }
```

## Add a SwiftUI List to `ConfigView`

We'll replace the contents of `ConfigView` and add a list that show's each `Habit`'s name.

```swift title='UI/ConfigView.swift'
struct ConfigView: View {    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(habits.habits) { habit in
                Text("\(habit.name)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Identifiable

If we compile, we'll get this error:

```
Referencing initializer 'init(_:content:)' on 'ForEach' requires that 'Habit' conform to 'Identifiable'
```

We need that `Habits`, `Habit` conform to `RealmSwift.ObjectKeyIdentifiable`, so we can use them easily with `ForEach`

```swift title='/Model/Habit.swift'
class Habit: Object, ObjectKeyIdentifiable {
```

```swift title='/Model/Habits.swift'
class Habits: Object, ObjectKeyIdentifiable {
```

## The Preview

Is empty! That's because we're passing an empty `Habits()` object that has no `Habit` inside. Let's fix this adding some data to our Realm.
