# Passing an initial List of Habits

Right now, in `MainView` we're passing an empty `Habits` variable to `ConfigView`. We need to create and insert one Habits in the Realm so the information we add in our `HabitDetailView` is persisted.

## Adding all Habits to MainView

We'll add a query that will read all `Habits` from the Database. When we start the app for the first time, there's nothing in there. We also need to `import RealmSwift`.

```swift title='/Views/MainView.swift'
    @ObservedResults(Habits.self) var allHabitGroups
```

## ProgressView or Tab

If we still don't have anything in our Database, we'll present a ProgressView. If we have something, we'll show the `TabView`.

- in `MainView` we can then pass an initial list of habits

```swift title='/Views/MainView.swift'
var body: some View {
    // we need at least a Habits group to start adding habits
    if let habits = allHabitGroups.first {
        TabView {
            TodayView()
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "calendar")
                    Text("Today")
                }
            ConfigView(habits: habits)
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "wrench.and.screwdriver")
                    Text("Config")
                }
        }
    } else {
        ProgressView()
    }
}
```

## Adding a new Habits at startup

To have an instance of `Habits`, we'll add it when our `ProgressView` if shown.

```swift title='/Views/MainView.swift'
// if no Habits group, we add one
ProgressView()
    .onAppear {
        $allHabitGroups.append(Habits())
    }
```

## Testing on Sim

- we can now run the app, add, delete, edit and reorder habits!
- we can even use SimPholders and open the DB with MongoDB Realm Studio!
