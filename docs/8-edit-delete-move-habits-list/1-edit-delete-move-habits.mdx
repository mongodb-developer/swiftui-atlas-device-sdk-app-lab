# Edit, delete and move buttons

## Edit button

- we'll add an Edit Button to the `ConfigView`. This way the List will enter Edit mode to delete / move rows. When we move or delete a row, this will be reflected in Realm.

```swift title='ConfigView.swift'
    List {
        /// same code
    }
    .navigationBarItems(trailing: EditButton())
```

## Move and delete buttons

- we add to `ForEach` these two lines:

```swift title='ConfigView.swift'
.onDelete(perform: $habits.habits.remove)
.onMove(perform: $habits.habits.move)
```

Now we can swipe the cell and get a working delete button that'll call `$habits.habits.remove`, removing this object from the Realm when we remove the row from the list.

We can also enter Edit mode and move cells around thanks to `$habits.habits.move`.
