# Summary and Next Steps

Congratulations! Following this tutorial, you have successfully:
* created a SwiftUI App,
* added the Swift Atlas Device SDK,
* constructed an App that persist data locally,
* defined Models,
* migrated schemas,
* and added powerful Previews to your app.

## Next Steps

You __next step__ will be to __add Atlas Device Sync to this app__, so it stores data in MongoDB Atlas (not only locally). We have a [Sync your iOS SwiftUI App with MongoDB Atlas using Atlas Device Sync](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-atlas-sync-app-lab/) lab designed just for this!.
