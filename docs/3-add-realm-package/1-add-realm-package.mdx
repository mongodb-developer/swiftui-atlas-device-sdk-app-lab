# Add the RealmSwift package

We'll use Realm as our Database, to store data locally on the phone. We can [add the Realm SDK as a external dependency using various methods in iOS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/swift/install/#installation). Here, we'll use Apple's Swift Package Manager. 

- [1] click on your Project file (blue file at the top)
- [2] click on the project info icon just above TARGETS
- [3] open the Package Dependencies tab
- [4] click on the + button
- add https://github.com/realm/realm-swift.git
- select Realm Swift
- select a Simulator and build the app (the 1st time you build the Realm SDK takes some time, then it's cached so you don't need to)
