# Create the Project

- open Xcode and create a new iOS App Project called `GoodHabitsRealmApp`
    - as organization identifier we'll use: `com.mongodb` (although you can use your own)
    - it's a Swift / SwiftUI project, so choose SwiftUI for Interface and Swift for Language.

- once created, rename `ContentView` into `MainView` (you can right-click on `ContentView` in the code editor and select Refactor > Rename)
  - also rename the preview to be `struct MainView_Previews: PreviewProvider`
- compile and see the preview
