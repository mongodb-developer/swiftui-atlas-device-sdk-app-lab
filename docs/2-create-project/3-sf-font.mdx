# Tab Bar icons

- to improve the tabs, we can add some icons. We'll select those icons from the [SF Symbols font](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/)

```swift title="MainView.swift"
TabView {
    Text("Today")
        .tabItem {
            Image(systemName: "calendar")
            Text("Today")
        }
    Text("Config")
        .tabItem {
            Image(systemName: "wrench.and.screwdriver")
            Text("Config")
        }
}
```

- To find the icons and their identifiers, you can install the [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) that contains thousands of icons we can use directly in our apps.
