# Realm Environment Variables

## Environment .realm  

Atlas Device SDK defines several [environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment) variables in SwiftUI, we've already used one in this preview:

To use this data we change the preview in `ConfigView.swift`. We can call `realmWithData` as it's a `static` member of `PreviewProvider` now.

```swift title='ConfigView.swift'
struct ConfigView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        let realm =  realmWithData()
        return ConfigView(habits: realm.objects(Habits.self).first!)
            .environment(\.realm, realm)
    }
}
```

The default Realm is created by the Atlas Device SDK and we can access it using the path `\.realm`, but we can inject a new realm to other views down our hierarchy using:

```swift
.environment(\.realm, realm)
```

## Environment .realmConfig

We can also change the default Realm Config and inject it using the environment with:

```swift
.environment(\.realmConfig, realmConfig)
```
