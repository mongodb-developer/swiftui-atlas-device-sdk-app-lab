# Build a SwiftUI App that stores data locally using the Realm SDK

In this hands-on lab you will build, starting from scratch, a SwiftUI iOS app that stores data using the Realm SDK locally (not syncing to MongoDB).

This repo contains the Docusaurus source code and documents needed to build the lab website. You can learn how we use Docusaurus in this [lab](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/docusaurus-workshop).

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
