# Build a SwiftUI App that stores data locally using the Atlas Device SDK

In this hands-on lab you will build, starting from scratch, a SwiftUI iOS app that stores data using the Atlas Device SDK (Realm) locally (not syncing to MongoDB).

ðŸš€ Try it [here](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/swiftui-atlas-device-sdk-app-lab/)

This repo contains the Docusaurus source code and documents needed to build the lab website. You can learn how we use Docusaurus in this [lab](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/docusaurus-workshop).

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
